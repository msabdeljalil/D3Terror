Karzai's running mate survives assassination attempt, two killed

LENGTH: 377 words

DATELINE: KABUL Oct 6

Afghan President Hamid Karzai's running mate survived an assassination attempt Wednesday when a bomb killed two people and injured seven as he drove in a convoy to an election rally, officials said.

Karzai's candidate for first vice president, Ahmad Zia Massoud, was not injured in the attack in Faizabad, the capital of Badakhshan province, interior ministry spokesman Lutfullah Mashal told AFP.

A remote-controlled mine hit the second car in the convoy just after Massoud's vehicle passed by, he said. A spokesman for the ousted Taliban regime later claimed responsibility.

NATO peacekeepers issued a statement saying that two people were killed and seven were injured in the attack ahead of Afghanistan's first presidential elections on Saturday.

The injured included the governor of Badakhshan province, Said Mohaamad Ekramudin, and the Minister for Pilgrimage and Religious Foundations, Mohammad Amir Nasergar, a spokesman said.

""A Belgian C-130 Hercules Aircraft provided airlift support this afternoon for some of those who were tragically killed and injured in this mornings attack,"" he said in a statement.

Taliban spokesman Abdul Latif Hakimi told AFP in a telephone call from an undisclosed location: ""We take responsibility for the attack on Ahmad Zia Massoud today in Badakhshan province.

""As we have said in the past our prime targets are the presidential candidates and secondly their vice presidents and all those people helping them.""

Ahmad Zia Massoud is the brother of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the assassinated hero of the fight against the Soviet occupation in the 1980s and of the later struggle against the hardline Islamic Taliban regime.

The bomb blast was the latest in a series of attacks in the run-up to the elections. Hundreds of people have been killed this year in an insurgency by remnants of the Taliban regime, ousted by the US-led invasion in late 2001.

Officials have warned of a possible sharp rise in attacks on election day when up to 10.5 million registered voters go to the polls, with major cities at risk of car-bomb blasts and polling stations under threat of armed assault.

Nearly 60,000 Afghan police and soldiers backed by 27,000 international troops will be in position to protect the 5,000 polling stations throughout the country.",National Political,No,Yes,Government,Search & Destroy,NA,,
